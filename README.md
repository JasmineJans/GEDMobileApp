# GEDMobileApp
Senior Design Project - GED Mobile App - Algrbra Preparation

Year long (Fall 2016 - Spring 2017) capstone project at Gonzaga University
Team members: Jasmine Jans, Myanna Harris, Jimmy Sherman and Kristina Spring

For this project we worked with The Next Generation Zone, a young adult career center in downtown Spokane who largely helps non-traditional students prepare for the GED exam. These students struggle specifically with math, don't do well in a traditional classroom and would rather be on their phones. Partnering with Trina Clayeux, the director of the next generation zone, we proposed the idea of a GED prep mobile app for android that caters specifically to the algebra math sections of the GED. 9 months later we have a nearly completed product.

Jasmine's specific contributions: All acheivement files, madlib game view, database helper, main activity, game intro page, game content, database design, and other contributions strewn throughout all files.
